# NextJS Starter in Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Project Description

This project is a basic NextJS starter template pre-configured for deployment on Firebase using Firebase Studio. It provides a foundational structure for building modern web applications with NextJS, leveraging the power of React for the UI, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Technology Stack

*   **NextJS:** A React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites.
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
*   **Firebase:** A platform for building web and mobile applications, providing services like hosting, databases, authentication, and more.

## Getting Started

1.  **Explore the code:** Begin by examining `/src/app/page.tsx` to understand the basic page structure.
2.  **Install dependencies:** Run `npm install` or `yarn install` in the project root.
3.  **Run locally:** Start the development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
4.  **Deploy to Firebase:** Use the Firebase CLI to deploy your project. Refer to the Firebase documentation for detailed deployment instructions.
